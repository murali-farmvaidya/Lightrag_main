Highly effective Bio-encapsulation (patented technology)\nensures the availability of these Mycorrhiza variants in both granular and liquid states.\nBenefits:\n•Significantly improves absorption of phosphorus from the soil through its intricate root\nnetwork, fostering plant growth even in soils with diminished phosphorus levels.\n•Augments the population, contributing to enhanced nutrient uptake and overall plant vi-\ntality.\n•Acts as a shield, safeguarding plants from soil-borne diseases and resulting in healthier\ncrops.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 10 kg per acre for granular form, 5 litres per acre for liquid form.\n•Granular Form: Apply granules directly to the soil during final ploughing or when sowing\nseeds.\n•Liquid Form: Administer during the initial phase – either at planting or shortly thereafter.\n8\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: A single application during the cropping season is sufficient.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 1 to 2 times annually.\nCaution:\n•For granular form: Ensure thorough mixing during seedbed preparation.\n•For liquid form: Apply directly to roots during planting or shortly afterwards.\n3.3 N-Factor & P-Factor\n3.3.1 N-Factor – Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria\nN-Factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria that play a key role in stabilizing nitrogen\nin the environment. In one millilitre of liquid, a minimum of 1x10 bacteria is present. These\nbacteria, through release of various enzymes into the environment, convert atmospheric nitrogen\n(N) into immediately absorbable forms such as ammonia (NH) or nitrate (NO) for plants.\nBenefits:\n•Stabilizes 20 to 40 kg of nitrogen per hectare, significantly enhancing nitrogen availability.\n•Reduces need for chemical fertilizers by 25-30%.\n•Stimulates release of auxins, gibberellic acid, and cytokinins, fostering plant growth.\n•Improves moisture absorption capacity of plants from soil, resulting in 10-15% increase in\ncrop yield in rain-fed areas.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initially, apply through seed treatment using seed-dip method, followed by foliar spray\nduring subsequent stages.\n•In case of weather changes, apply 1 litre per acre as foliar spray.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.3.2 P-Factor – Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria\nThe P-Factor represents liquid living fertilizer, a potent blend of free-living and endophytic\nbacteria designed to unlock the power of phosphorus in neutral soil conditions. With a con-\ncentration of at least 1x10 bacteria per millilitre, this solution harnesses the natural ability of\nbacteria to solubilize phosphorus. Once applied, these bacteria seamlessly integrate into the\nsoil, releasing enzymes that dissolve inaccessible phosphorus and transform it into a readily\navailable form for plants.\n9\nBenefits:\n•Provides a substantial yield of 25–30 kg of phosphorus per hectare, reducing reliance on\nchemical fertilizers by 20–25%.\n•Stimulates secretion of specific hormones and bio-chemicals in the root region, fostering\nplant growth.\n•Results in a significant boost in crop yield (15–20%), contributing to sustainable and\nefficient agricultural practices.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initiate via drip irrigation initially, followed by strategic spraying during subsequent stages.\n•Apply during sowing or spraying for continuous release in crop root zone.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.4 K-FACTOR\nK-factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria in the rhizosphere, which are responsible\nfor mobilizing potassium in the soil. In one millilitre of fluid, there are at least 1x10 bacteria.\nThese bacteria, after entering the soil, release a variety of organic acids and enzymes into the\nroot zone. As a result, they facilitate the assimilation of potassium, making it more available\nto plants.\nAdvantages:\n•Improves potassium availability to plants from early stages, promotes strong root develop-\nment, stem and tuber formation. In addition, it contributes to increase the arrangement\nof flowers and fruits.\n•Reduces the need for chemical potassium fertilizers by 20-25%.\n•Exhibits antagonistic properties against various plant pathogens, contributes better disease\nresistance, improves plant vigor and yield.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 liter per acre.\n•Initially, apply by seed treatment using seedling dipping method, followed by foliar spray\nduring growth stages.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops, a single application per\n```",

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

These granules and liquid variants\nact as a vital conduit for plant sustenance. Within a mere gram or millilitre, a minimum of 10\nmycorrhizal spores is encapsulated. Highly effective Bio-encapsulation (patented technology)\nensures the availability of these Mycorrhiza variants in both granular and liquid states.\nBenefits:\n•Significantly improves absorption of phosphorus from the soil through its intricate root\nnetwork, fostering plant growth even in soils with diminished phosphorus levels.\n•Augments the population, contributing to enhanced nutrient uptake and overall plant vi-\ntality.\n•Acts as a shield, safeguarding plants from soil-borne diseases and resulting in healthier\ncrops.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 10 kg per acre for granular form, 5 litres per acre for liquid form.\n•Granular Form: Apply granules directly to the soil during final ploughing or when sowing\nseeds.\n•Liquid Form: Administer during the initial phase – either at planting or shortly thereafter.\n8\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: A single application during the cropping season is sufficient.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 1 to 2 times annually.\nCaution:\n•For granular form: Ensure thorough mixing during seedbed preparation.\n•For liquid form: Apply directly to roots during planting or shortly afterwards.\n3.3 N-Factor & P-Factor\n3.3.1 N-Factor – Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria\nN-Factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria that play a key role in stabilizing nitrogen\nin the environment. In one millilitre of liquid, a minimum of 1x10 bacteria is present. These\nbacteria, through release of various enzymes into the environment, convert atmospheric nitrogen\n(N) into immediately absorbable forms such as ammonia (NH) or nitrate (NO) for plants.\nBenefits:\n•Stabilizes 20 to 40 kg of nitrogen per hectare, significantly enhancing nitrogen availability.\n•Reduces need for chemical fertilizers by 25-30%.\n•Stimulates release of auxins, gibberellic acid, and cytokinins, fostering plant growth.\n•Improves moisture absorption capacity of plants from soil, resulting in 10-15% increase in\ncrop yield in rain-fed areas.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initially, apply through seed treatment using seed-dip method, followed by foliar spray\nduring subsequent stages.\n•In case of weather changes, apply 1 litre per acre as foliar spray.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.3.2 P-Factor – Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria\nThe P-Factor represents liquid living fertilizer, a potent blend of free-living and endophytic\nbacteria designed to unlock the power of phosphorus in neutral soil conditions. With a con-\ncentration of at least 1x10 bacteria per millilitre, this solution harnesses the natural ability of\nbacteria to solubilize phosphorus. Once applied, these bacteria seamlessly integrate into the\nsoil, releasing enzymes that dissolve inaccessible phosphorus and transform it into a readily\navailable form for plants.\n9\nBenefits:\n•Provides a substantial yield of 25–30 kg of phosphorus per hectare, reducing reliance on\nchemical fertilizers by 20–25%.\n•Stimulates secretion of specific hormones and bio-chemicals in the root region, fostering\nplant growth.\n•Results in a significant boost in crop yield (15–20%), contributing to sustainable and\nefficient agricultural practices.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initiate via drip irrigation initially, followed by strategic spraying during subsequent stages.\n•Apply during sowing or spraying for continuous release in crop root zone.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.4 K-FACTOR\nK-factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria in the rhizosphere, which are responsible\nfor mobilizing potassium in the soil. In one millilitre of fluid, there are at least 1x10 bacteria.\nThese bacteria, after entering the soil, release a variety of organic acids and enzymes into the\nroot zone. As a result, they facilitate the assimilation of potassium, making it more available\nto plants.\nAdvantages:\n•Improves potassium availability to plants from early stages, promotes strong root develop-\nment, stem and tuber formation. In addition, it contributes to increase the arrangement\nof flowers and fruits.\n•Reduces the need for chemical potassium fertilizers by 20-25%.\n•Exhibits antagonistic properties against various plant pathogens, contributes better disease\nresistance, improves plant vigor and yield.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 liter per acre.\n•Initially, apply by seed treatment using seedling dipping method, followed by foliar spray\nduring growth stages.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops, a single application per\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

Scientific rationale: Fermentation ensures faster nutrient uptake. Success stories:\nFarmers in Telangana observed 20–25% higher yield and stronger roots after repeated use.\n5 Biofactor’s chemical fertilizers:\nToday the agricultural sector is facing harsher and more unpredictable weather conditions than\never before. Similarly, the soil’s nutrient capacity and microbial population are reduced. Al-\nthough farmers use traditional chem ical fertilizers found in the market, the nutrient availability\nand utilization efficiency of plants has decreased due to the high particle size of these nutrients.\nTo overcome these problems, Biofactor has developed the Microbe Metabolite Assisted Micron\nSized Par ticles (MAMSP) technology, which uses microbes to microsize the particle size. All\nthe products made using this technology have very small sized of nutrients. Thus the availability\nand utilization efficiency of nutrients to plants increases. They work with three times higher\nefficiency compared to regular fertilizers. Therefore the biofactor can get more results using less\nquantity of their chemical nutrients\nPOTASSIUM THIOSULPHATE - 25% A liquid nutrient mixture that provides potassium.\nIt contains 25% potash as well as calcium, boron and manganese required for flowering and\nfruiting de velopment. Formulated using MAMS (Microbe Assisted Microsize Particle) tech\nnology.Thereby increasing nutrient availability and utilization efficiency.After use of High-K\nSugar content in fruits increases and fruit pulp enhances due to which fruit gets more sweetened\nget more shining and gaining more weight that im proves quality of fruit.\n19\nAdvantages:\n•Spraying during the flowering stage helps in healthy flowers (more female f lowers) and\nmore pollination.\n•Spraying at the pod stage contributes to more pod formation, more harvests, less pod drop,\nmore seeds in pods formed and higher quality\n•Increases resistance to insects and pests. Helps to withstand water stress.\nDosage:\n•Spray method 500 - 800 ml/acre (2.5-4.0 ml/liter of water)\nApplication:\n•Give the plants by spraying or drip irrigation during flowering stage, pod growth and\nfruiting stages.\nFrequency:\n•Spray or drip irrigation - once every 7-10 days\n5.0.1 CHELATED ZINC AS ZINC GLYCINE (LIQUID)\nLiquid nutrient mixture providing zinc nutrient (6.8%).

Scientific rationale: Fermentation ensures faster nutrient uptake. Success stories:\nFarmers in Telangana observed 20–25% higher yield and stronger roots after repeated use.\n5 Biofactor’s chemical fertilizers:\nToday the agricultural sector is facing harsher and more unpredictable weather conditions than\never before. Similarly, the soil’s nutrient capacity and microbial population are reduced. Al-\nthough farmers use traditional chem ical fertilizers found in the market, the nutrient availability\nand utilization efficiency of plants has decreased due to the high particle size of these nutrients.\nTo overcome these problems, Biofactor has developed the Microbe Metabolite Assisted Micron\nSized Par ticles (MAMSP) technology, which uses microbes to microsize the particle size. All\nthe products made using this technology have very small sized of nutrients. Thus the availability\nand utilization efficiency of nutrients to plants increases. They work with three times higher\nefficiency compared to regular fertilizers. Therefore the biofactor can get more results using less\nquantity of their chemical nutrients\nPOTASSIUM THIOSULPHATE - 25% A liquid nutrient mixture that provides potassium.\nIt contains 25% potash as well as calcium, boron and manganese required for flowering and\nfruiting de velopment. Formulated using MAMS (Microbe Assisted Microsize Particle) tech\nnology.Thereby increasing nutrient availability and utilization efficiency.After use of High-K\nSugar content in fruits increases and fruit pulp enhances due to which fruit gets more sweetened\nget more shining and gaining more weight that im proves quality of fruit.\n19\nAdvantages:\n•Spraying during the flowering stage helps in healthy flowers (more female f lowers) and\nmore pollination.\n•Spraying at the pod stage contributes to more pod formation, more harvests, less pod drop,\nmore seeds in pods formed and higher quality\n•Increases resistance to insects and pests. Helps to withstand water stress.\nDosage:\n•Spray method 500 - 800 ml/acre (2.5-4.0 ml/liter of water)\nApplication:\n•Give the plants by spraying or drip irrigation during flowering stage, pod growth and\nfruiting stages.\nFrequency:\n•Spray or drip irrigation - once every 7-10 days\n5.0.1 CHELATED ZINC AS ZINC GLYCINE (LIQUID)\nLiquid nutrient mixture providing zinc nutrient (6.8%).

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

    "return": "Biofertilizers are essential in modern farming as they help improve soil health and increase crop yield by enhancing nutrient availability to plants. Let's look at four important factors commonly found in biofertilizers: N-Factor, P-Factor, K-Factor, and Zn-Factor.\n\n### N-Factor (Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria)\n- **What It Is**: N-Factor is a type of bacteria that helps in fixing atmospheric nitrogen into the soil.\n- **How It Helps**: These bacteria convert nitrogen from the air into forms that plants can easily absorb, thus providing a natural source of nitrogen which is crucial for plant growth.\n- **Benefit**: Using N-Factor can reduce the need for chemical fertilizers by 25-30%, leading to healthier crops and lower farming costs.\n\n### P-Factor (Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria)\n- **What It Is**: P-Factor consists of bacteria that help in solubilizing phosphorus present in the soil.\n- **How It Helps**: Phosphorus is vital for plant energy transfer and root development. P-Factor bacteria turn phosphorus into a form that plants can access more easily.\n- **Benefit**: This leads to better root growth and increased yields, while also reducing the need for chemical phosphorus fertilizers by 20-25%.\n\n### K-Factor (Potassium Mobilizing Bacteria)\n- **What It Is**: K-Factor includes bacteria that help make potassium available to plants.\n- **How It Helps**: Potassium is important for overall plant health, aiding in fruit formation and disease resistance. K-Factor bacteria break down potassium in the soil, making it more available.\n- **Benefit**: Similar to the other factors, K-Factor can reduce the amount of chemical potassium fertilizers needed, often by 20-25%.\n\n### Zn-Factor (Zinc Solubilizing Bacteria)\n- **What It Is**: Zn-Factor represents bacteria that help solubilize zinc in the soil.\n- **How It Helps**: Zinc is essential for various plant functions, including growth and enzyme functions. Zn-Factor bacteria work to increase the availability of zinc to plants.\n- **Benefit**: This results in better crop health and growth, helping to overcome deficiencies that might occur if zinc levels are low.\n\nBy using biofertilizers that contain these factors, farmers can achieve better crop yields, reduce dependence on chemical fertilizers, and promote sustainable farming practices. Each of these factors plays a unique role in ensuring that essential nutrients are accessible to plants, allowing them to thrive. \n\n### References\n- [1] Biofactor knowledge base 21112025.pdf",

Unlike generic speech recognition systems, this ASR understands regional agricultural terminology, local crop names, dialects, and rural accents, enabling farmers to interact with digital platforms effortlessly through voice.\n3.a. project : Rythuvaani - Rythuvaani is building a Telugu agriculture domain-specific dataset for building the Speech-to-Text (STT) system that understands conversational speech in all regional dialects.\nWe are collecting 30,000 hours of conversational agricultural audio from all 59 districts, ensuring a minimum of 500 hours per district to accurately capture every local dialect and speech variation. This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n\n4.

    "return": "The differences between P-Factor and K-Factor are as follows:\n\n1. **Function**: P-Factor refers to phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria that enhance the availability of phosphorus in the soil, while K-Factor relates to potassium-mobilizing bacteria that help improve potassium accessibility for plants.\n\n2. **Nutrient Role**: P-Factor specifically aids in unlocking phosphorus, which is crucial for energy transfer and photosynthesis in plants, while K-Factor is essential for promoting strong root systems, fruit development, and overall plant vigor by mobilizing potassium.\n\n3. **Application**: P-Factor is typically used to augment phosphorus levels in neutral soil conditions, facilitating plant access to this nutrient; K-Factor is employed to help plants assimilate potassium effectively, especially in soils where potassium is inadequately available.\n\n4. **Dosage and Method**: P-Factor is generally applied in liquid form with a recommended dosage of about 1 liter per acre, and it can be introduced through methods such as drip irrigation or foliar spray. K-Factor, on the other hand, is also suggested for application at about 1 liter per acre, typically following seed treatment methods and incorporating foliar sprays during growth stages.\n\n5. **Impact on Crop Yield**: The application of P-Factor can lead to significant increases in nutrient uptake and crop yield improvements in the range of 15-20%, while K-Factor contributes by reducing the reliance on chemical potassium fertilizers by approximately 20-25%, enhancing plant health and productivity.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Biofactor knowledge base 21112025.pdf",

    "return": "To improve the yield of your BPT-5204 paddy, you can consider the following approaches based on the practices mentioned:\n\n1. **Nutrient Management**: While you are applying urea and DAP, consider integrating organic fertilizers such as Poshak Level-1. This liquid fermented organic fertilizer is particularly beneficial during the vegetative stage of paddy. It enhances root strength and improves foliage health, addressing nutrient loss and helping in larger grain formation. The recommended dosage is typically around 1 L per acre applied through irrigation every 7–10 days.\n\n2. **Soil Health**: Utilizing bio-fertilizers like Aadhaar Gold can also be advantageous. This product combines nitrogen-fixing, phosphate-solubilizing, and potassium-mobilizing bacteria, significantly promoting soil fertility and crop productivity. Apply about 4 kg per acre to strengthen soil health and root growth.\n\n3. **Pest and Disease Management**: Continue to monitor for pests and diseases closely. Consider using biological control methods alongside chemical pesticides for sustainable management. For instance, integrating products like Invictus can help manage soil-borne diseases affecting the roots, which can subsequently affect grain size and yield.\n\n4. **Water Management**: Ensure efficient irrigation. The Drop Method, where nutrient solutions are directly applied near water outputs, can guarantee an even distribution of nutrients until natural watering occurs, optimizing nutrient uptake.\n\n5. **Timely Interventions**: Use the right methods for seed treatment and during the different growth stages of your crop. Engaging products like ZN-FACTOR for treating seed can enhance nutrient uptake, which may improve overall growth and yield.\n\n6. **Foliar Sprays**: Utilize foliar nutrient sprays when essential nutrient deficiencies are observed, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and fruit setting, to enhance grain development.\n\nBy implementing these strategies specifically designed for paddy cultivation, you can potentially increase the yield and size of your grains significantly.\n\n### References\n- [1] Biofactor knowledge base 21112025.pdf",

    "return": "To improve the yield of your paddy crop and enhance the size of the grains, you can consider the following practices:\n\n1. **Nutrient Application**: Applying Poshak Level-1 can significantly help paddy during the vegetative stage. This product is designed to address issues related to nutrient loss and promote root strength, which is crucial for grain development.\n\n2. **Biofertilizer Usage**: Consider using Aadhaar Gold, a carrier consortium granular biofertilizer that enhances soil fertility through the activity of beneficial microbes. Using it during the vegetative stage can lead to a 25-30% increase in yield.\n\n3. **Soil Health Enhancements**: Improving soil structure and nutrient availability is vital. Regularly applying granular biofertilizers and organic manures can help in establishing a healthier soil ecosystem, which in turn supports better crop growth.\n\n4. **Water Management**: Ensure that your paddy fields are well-watered, especially during crucial growth stages. Waterlogged conditions need to be avoided, as they can hinder root development and grain filling.\n\n5. **Consult Local Resources**: It's beneficial to collaborate with local agricultural experts or extension services to tailor your approach based on the specific conditions of your farm.\n\nImplementing these strategies could lead to better grain size and overall yield improvement in your paddy crop.",

I recommend using **Invictus**, which is a biological control product effective against various soil-borne and airborne fungal pathogens. \n\nInvictus contains Trichoderma viride, which helps in controlling the fungal diseases affecting your crop. It promotes healthier plants by improving root vigor and suppressing the pathogens responsible for these diseases. \n\nYou can apply Invictus according to the guidelines, typically at a dosage of 10 kg per acre mixed with well-decomposed organic matter. This application can help restore the health of your plants and improve overall crop yield.\n\nIf the symptoms persist, it may also be advisable to review other potential environmental stressors and provide appropriate care to promote recovery in your chili plants.",

Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Here are a few potential causes and solutions:\n\n1. **Zinc Deficiency**: This is characterized by yellowing and browning of tender leaves, particularly in horticultural crops. Consider using a liquid nutrient mixture that addresses zinc deficiency symptoms.\n\n2. **Iron Deficiency**: Symptoms include leaves losing their green color and turning white (chlorosis), which may also lead to stunted growth. An iron nutrient mixture can be beneficial when this deficiency is observed.\n\n3. **Magnesium Deficiency**: If the center or entire leaf turns yellow and leaves become smaller, magnesium may be lacking. A nutrient mixture providing magnesium can help mitigate this issue.\n\n4. **Fungal Disease**: Some discoloration may result from fungal infections, such as Alternaria, which causes leaf spots. In such cases, using a biological fungicide like Pentazia can provide control against these diseases while offering vital nutrients.\n\nIf you provide more details about the specific crops and the timing of the symptoms, I can offer more tailored advice.",

    "return": "Small grain size in paddy can often result from several factors, including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or improper management practices. \n\nTo improve grain size, you can consider the following actions:\n\n1. **Nutrient Management**: Ensure that your paddy is receiving adequate nutrition. Poshak Level-1, a liquid fermented organic fertilizer, can help improve nutrient uptake and promote healthy foliage, which is essential during the vegetative stage. It's particularly beneficial for paddy to remedy nutrient loss and enhance root strength.\n\n2. **Soil Health**: Enhance soil fertility and structure by using biofertilizers such as Aadhaar Gold, which provides complete NPK nutrition organically and promotes better root development. Farmers have reported significant yield improvements when using it.\n\n3. **Water Management**: Ensure that your paddy receives sufficient water without waterlogging, which can affect grain development. Proper irrigation techniques help maintain optimal moisture levels.\n\n4. **Pest and Disease Control**: Monitor for any signs of pest infestations or diseases, as these can also impair growth and grain formation. Products like Invictus can help manage soil-borne diseases that may affect crop health.\n\n5. **Crop Trials**: Review trial data and farmer feedback in your region for practical tips and methods that have successfully increased grain size in neighboring fields.\n\nRegularly assessing the nutritional and environmental conditions of your paddy can help in making timely adjustments to enhance grain quality.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Biofactor knowledge base 21112025.pdf",

It includes nitrogen-fixing microorganisms that can help replenish the nitrogen levels in your soil while also enhancing soil fertility and crop productivity.\n\n2. **N-Factor**: This product consists of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that stabilize atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a form that plants can absorb. It’s especially beneficial for increasing the nitrogen content in soils where it's lacking.\n\nThese products will help improve the nitrogen levels in your soil while complementing the existing phosphorus and potassium levels, which can lead to better overall plant health and yield.",
