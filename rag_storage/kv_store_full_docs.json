Scientific rationale: Fermentation ensures faster nutrient uptake. Success stories:\nFarmers in Telangana observed 20–25% higher yield and stronger roots after repeated use.\n5 Biofactor’s chemical fertilizers:\nToday the agricultural sector is facing harsher and more unpredictable weather conditions than\never before. Similarly, the soil’s nutrient capacity and microbial population are reduced. Al-\nthough farmers use traditional chem ical fertilizers found in the market, the nutrient availability\nand utilization efficiency of plants has decreased due to the high particle size of these nutrients.\nTo overcome these problems, Biofactor has developed the Microbe Metabolite Assisted Micron\nSized Par ticles (MAMSP) technology, which uses microbes to microsize the particle size. All\nthe products made using this technology have very small sized of nutrients. Thus the availability\nand utilization efficiency of nutrients to plants increases. They work with three times higher\nefficiency compared to regular fertilizers. Therefore the biofactor can get more results using less\nquantity of their chemical nutrients\nPOTASSIUM THIOSULPHATE - 25% A liquid nutrient mixture that provides potassium.\nIt contains 25% potash as well as calcium, boron and manganese required for flowering and\nfruiting de velopment. Formulated using MAMS (Microbe Assisted Microsize Particle) tech\nnology.Thereby increasing nutrient availability and utilization efficiency.After use of High-K\nSugar content in fruits increases and fruit pulp enhances due to which fruit gets more sweetened\nget more shining and gaining more weight that im proves quality of fruit.\n19\nAdvantages:\n•Spraying during the flowering stage helps in healthy flowers (more female f lowers) and\nmore pollination.\n•Spraying at the pod stage contributes to more pod formation, more harvests, less pod drop,\nmore seeds in pods formed and higher quality\n•Increases resistance to insects and pests.

Vision - To empower every Indian smallholder farmer and agri-input                                                           enterprise through the transformative potential of Generative AI, fostering a    future of inclusive and sustainable agriculture.\n1.b. Mission - To build Generative AI-powered conversational voice agents that deliver real-time, personalized, and trustworthy agricultural solutions in regional Indian languages.\n1.c. values – \nInnovation : Continuously advancing Gen AI technology to revolutionize agricultural intelligence.\nQuality : Ensuring accuracy, authenticity, and excellence in every Gen AI-powered interaction.\nReal time : Providing instant, expert-backed agricultural support when it matters most.\nSustainability :  Promoting eco-friendly farming practices & responsible input recommendations.\nTrust : Building credibility with farmers, agri-businesses through trusted Gen AI-driven guidance. write the same only points with header and point\n\n2. Solution - A GenAI-powered multilingual conversational voice agent transforming stakeholder engagement in agri-input companies for faster, smarter, and scalable support. It connects farmers, dealers, and field officers through a unified platform,delivering instant, voice-enabled product insights in local languages.\nThis eliminates communication delays operates 24/7 without human intervention, reducing the load on support teams. It continuously learns from interactions, delivering personalized and contextual information. With multilingual support, it reaches deep into rural India.\n3. product – At FarmVaidya , we are building india’s first agricultural based ASR(Automatic Speech Recognisation). Unlike generic speech recognition systems, this ASR understands regional agricultural terminology, local crop names, dialects, and rural accents, enabling farmers to interact with digital platforms effortlessly through voice.\n3.a. project : Rythuvaani - Rythuvaani is building a Telugu agriculture domain-specific dataset for building the Speech-to-Text (STT) system that understands conversational speech in all regional dialects.\nWe are collecting 30,000 hours of conversational agricultural audio from all 59 districts, ensuring a minimum of 500 hours per district to accurately capture every local dialect and speech variation. This extensive dataset will be transformed into verified audio–text pairs for fine-tuning advanced open-source STT models. By building such a rich, domain-specific corpus, we aim to enable highly accurate, responsive, and farmer-friendly conversational AI that understands real-world agricultural communication across regions.\nThis dataset and STT model will directly empower 10 million farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Farmers will be able to interact with conversational voice agents for crop advisory, input access, market information, and government schemes.Governments and agri-tech companies will have access to a scalable, indigenous AI infrastructure built specifically for agriculture \n\n\n4.
